# Reddit_Image_Scraper

ImageDL.py can be used to scrape images from any subreddit. Need some PRAW-Knowledge and a Reddit-Script-ID to get this working.
Info here: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

IMGFixer.py deletes any files which are not images/ are broken. DO NOT PUT FILES OTHER THAN IMAGES IN THIS DIRECTORY!!!
It also checks wether PNG have an accidental .jpg extension or the other way around, then renames them.

Use at your own discretion.
